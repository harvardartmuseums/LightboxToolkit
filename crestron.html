        <h1>Crestron Panel</h1>
        <h2>This panel controls the screens, projectors, volume and AV inputs in the Lightbox Gallery.</h2>
        <p>The panel is located on the wall of the gallery closest to the elevators.</p>
        <p>The panel is touchscreen and changes to settings can only be made by someone with the passcode.</p> 
        <p>To turn on the panel, touch the "home" button.</p>
        <img src="photos/crestronlocked.png" />
        <p>Then tap the screen and enter the passcode.</p>
        <img src="photos/crestron.png" />
        <p id="volume" class="anchors">The upper bar on the left side controls the volume of the sound coming from the speakers. The lower bar controls the volume of the microphones--these are connected to the PC associated with the screens.</p>
        <img src="photos/Creston Panel Input.jpg" />
        <p id="hdmiswitch" class="anchors"> If you want to change the input from the PC located in the closet to the HDMI input behind the screens, change the selection under "Layout", select "Rack HDMI", make sure under "Rack Input" that "Rack HDMI" is selected, and tap "Video Wall" so that it reads "HDMI" instead of "PC". The HDMI port can be accessed from behind <a href="pcaccess.html#usbhdmi">the rightmost screen on the middle row.</a></p>
        <img src="photos/crestrondisplay.png" />
        <p> From the panel, the input for the PC's can be changed to HDMI, VGA or video.</p>
        <p>Touch "Display Controls" to open a screen from which you can turn each of the screens and projectors on or off individually. You can also select "Mute Display" if you need the projection off briefly without shutting the projectors down.</p>
        <img src="photos/crestronlayouts.png" />
        <p id="layouts" class="anchors">Touch "Layouts" to open a screen from which you can choose different configurations of displays&mdash;for example, nine separate monitors, or one continuous monitor&mdash;tap one to select it.</p>
        <p id="schedule" class="anchors">Touch "Schedule" to open a screen from which you can adjust the schedule that turns the screens and projectors on and off. The days of the week can be scheduled separately, and more than one schedule can be stored. Stored schedules, and the current schedule, can then be enabled or disabled individually.</p>
        <img src="photos/Creston Panel2 (2).jpg" />
        <p>The panel will logout automatically after about 30 seconds.</p>
