        <h2>Certain constraints apply to the physical space of the Lightbox. <br>
        If you intend to bring any additional equipment or components in to the Lightbox, it would be useful to draw out the Lightbox <a href="floorplan.jpg">Lightbox Floor Plan</a> where you intend to place each object, its measurements and materials, how you intend to mount or affix it, where cords and other components will lead, and any other relevant details. Please bring this to any proposal and project review meetings. </h2>
        <p>Please note the following while planning your project:</p>
          <p>Waivers are required for bringing art components in and out of the gallery and building.</p>
          <p>Any materials brought into the space (e.g., fabric screens) need to be fire rated.</p>
          <p>Cords cannot be in the path to the exits. Cords elsewhere on the floor must be taped down. Additionally, to comply with ADA guidelines as well as saftey regulations, cords cannot be placed in walkways or areas.</p>
