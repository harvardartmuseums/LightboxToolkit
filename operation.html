        <h2>This toolkit provides information on, and specifications about, the equipment used and available in the Lightbox Gallery.</h2>
        <br /><br />
        The Lightbox Gallery is an open ended experimental space in the Harvard Art Museums dedicated to projects and artworks that use new media and emerging technologies to explore the museums' collection.
        It is located in room number 5000 and is the only public gallery on the the fifth floor of the museums.

        <h1>Opening Files</h1>
        <h2>Projects can be opened directly from the Lightbox Gallery once they've been <a href="pcaccess.html#loadfiles">loaded onto the computers</a>.</h2>
        <p>Opening files with the full projector resolution, and at a 1920x1080 resolution on the screens, is easy: simply open the files as normal. (Different platforms may have different options for full screen or constrained viewing.)</p>
        <p>Opening files across all nine screens requires a program that will display across a multi-monitor setup; we have a kiosk launcher to open Internet Explorer at full resolution across the nine screens, and Processing also offers easy solutions for this problem.</p>
        <p>You can change the zoom level of files opened in IE using CTRL +, CTRL -, and CTRL 0. Note that CTRL 0 may zoom to 100%, but also may not&mdash;if the zoom level of the display itself is set to something other than 100%, IE will instead zoom to that zoom level.</p>

        <h1>Network Closet</h1>
        <h2>Located on the lower level of the Harvard Art Museums, the network closet contains the two PCs that control the displays on the fifth floor.</h2>
        <p>The closet is room number 0741. It can be accessed via the white double doors next to the collections management office, or via the glass double doors by security.</p>
        <p>Getting into the hallway that leads to the network closet requires a PIN; if you are a museums employee, speak to security about setting one up.</p>
        <img src="photos/11.jpg" />
        <p>The larger of the two PCs controls the nine screens, while the narrower controls the two projectors. DVI cables carry the AV signals from the PCs to input boxes connected to the Vista Spyder 20Xs and the Crestron Pro-3, from which Ethernet cables carry the signals up to the fifth floor. Other arrangements are occassionally devised based on the needs of the project.</p>
        <p>What you are trying to do will determine where you should <a href="pcaccess.html">access these PCs</a>. Tasks requiring a display and input devices, such as downloading a file from Dropbox, should be completed upstairs.</p>
        <img src="photos/10.jpg" />
        <p id="usb" class="anchors">USB ports are available on the front of each PC. In order to access the ones on the projector PC, open the righthand panel on its front.</p>
        <img src="photos/9.jpg" />
        <p id="disk" class="anchors">The screen PC has a disk drive, which similarly can be accessed by opening the panel on its front.</p>
        <img src="photos/25.jpg"  />
        <p id="powerall" class="anchors">To turn all of the equipment on or off&mdash;for example, in advance of and after a power outage&mdash;first turn off the PCs by shutting them down <a href="pcaccess.html#openfiles">using the keyboards upstairs</a>. Then turn off the Vista Spyders by lifting the clear boxes on their fronts and pressing the buttons underneath. The Spyders can be turned on the same way, but the PCs can only be turned on in the network closet.</p>
        <p id="poweron" class="anchors">If the PCs have been turned off, this is the only place from which they can be turned on: simply press the power button on the relevant device(s).</p>
        
        <h1>PC Access</h1>
        <h2>The PCs that connect to the projectors and screens can be controlled from both the network closet and the Lightbox Gallery.</h2>
        <p>If the PCs are off, they need to be turned on <a href="closet.html#poweron">from the network closet</a>.</p>
        <img src="photos/3.jpg" style="width:50%; height: auto; float: left" /> <img src="photos/4.jpg" style="width:50%; height: auto; float: right" />
        <p id="loadfiles" class="anchors" style="clear:both">In order to load files onto the PCs, you can use a USB device <a href="closet.html#usb">in the ports on the PCs themselves</a>, or in the ports accessible by folding out the screens in the Lightbox Gallery. The port for the projectors is behind the screen in the middle row of the right column, while the port for the screens is behind the bottom screen in the center column. Alternately, the PC for the screens also has a <a href="closet.html#disk">disk drive</a>, which is located in the network closet. In addition, you can retrieve your project from Dropbox or a similar service on one of the PCs from the Lightbox Gallery, <a href="#openfiles">using the keyboards located behind the screens</a>.</p>
        <img src="photos/5.jpg" style="width:33.333333%; height: auto; float: left"/><img src="photos/2.jpg" style="width:33.333333%; height: auto; float: left"/><img src="photos/1.jpg" style="width:33.333333%; height: auto; float: left"/>
        <p id="usbhdmi" class="anchors" style="clear:both">Behind each screen is access to electrical outlets, USB ports behind the middle right screen and center bottom screen, and an HDMI input behind the middle left screen (which you can <a href="crestron.html#hdmiswitch">make the main screen input</a>). To pull out the screens locate the tab hanging from the appropriate column labeled with the given row (BOT, MID, and TOP), and pull. Screens can be returned to their place by gently pushing them by the corners. When you're done, be sure to stow the tab among the cords at the bottom of the set of screens so they aren't visible.</p>  
        <img src="photos/shadeskeyboard.png" style="width:50%; height: auto; float:left" /><img src="photos/screenskeyboard.png" style="width:50%; height: auto; float:right" />
        <p id="openfiles" class="anchors" style="clear:both">To open files, start projects, and other tasks which require control of the PCs from the Lightbox Gallery, locate the keyboards tucked behind the screens on the righthand side. They should be labeled "SHADES" and "SCREENS".</p>
        <p>Please remember that shutting down the PCs is not reversible from the Lightbox Gallery: they can only be turned back on from the <a href="closet.html#turnon">network closet</a>.</p>
              
        <h1>Crestron Panel</h1>
        <h2>This panel controls the screens, projectors, volume and AV inputs in the Lightbox Gallery.</h2>
        <p>The panel is located on the wall of the gallery closest to the elevators.</p>
        <p>The panel is touchscreen and changes to settings can only be made by someone with the passcode.</p> 
        <p>To turn on the panel, touch the "home" button.</p>
        <img src="photos/crestronlocked.png" />
        <p>Then tap the screen and enter the passcode.</p>
        <img src="photos/crestron.png" />
        <p id="volume" class="anchors">The upper bar on the left side controls the volume of the sound coming from the speakers. The lower bar controls the volume of the microphones--these are connected to the PC associated with the screens.</p>
        <img src="photos/Creston Panel Input.jpg" />
        <p id="hdmiswitch" class="anchors"> If you want to change the input from the PC located in the closet to the HDMI input behind the screens, change the selection under "Layout", select "Rack HDMI", make sure under "Rack Input" that "Rack HDMI" is selected, and tap "Video Wall" so that it reads "HDMI" instead of "PC". The HDMI port can be accessed from behind <a href="pcaccess.html#usbhdmi">the rightmost screen on the middle row.</a></p>
        <img src="photos/crestrondisplay.png" />
        <p> From the panel, the input for the PC's can be changed to HDMI, VGA or video.</p>
        <p>Touch "Display Controls" to open a screen from which you can turn each of the screens and projectors on or off individually. You can also select "Mute Display" if you need the projection off briefly without shutting the projectors down.</p>
        <img src="photos/crestronlayouts.png" />
        <p id="layouts" class="anchors">Touch "Layouts" to open a screen from which you can choose different configurations of displays&mdash;for example, nine separate monitors, or one continuous monitor&mdash;tap one to select it.</p>
        <p id="schedule" class="anchors">Touch "Schedule" to open a screen from which you can adjust the schedule that turns the screens and projectors on and off. The days of the week can be scheduled separately, and more than one schedule can be stored. Stored schedules, and the current schedule, can then be enabled or disabled individually.</p>
        <img src="photos/Creston Panel2 (2).jpg" />
        <p>The panel will logout automatically after about 30 seconds.</p>

        <h1>Shade Controls</h1>
        <h2>The shades in the Lightbox gallery can be lowered remotely using a VPN, creating a projection surface opposite the screens.</h2>
        <p>Controlling the shades requires access to the HAMEMBEDIA VPN tunnel.</p>
        <img src="photos/24.jpg" /> 
        <p>To connect to the tunnel, open Ciscio AnyConnect and click "Connect." Enter your Harvard email address followed by "#HAMEMBEDIA" in the username blank, and your HarvardKey password in the password blank. Acquire a two-step verification key and enter it into the third blank, and then click "Okay". You will have to accept the brief terms statement before proceeding.</p>
        <p>You will then have to login to the shade control GUI using a browser.</p>
        <img src="photos/23.jpg" />
        <p>Once there, under "Floorplans", click "Level 5". The Lightbox Gallery is Room 5000. Then select "5000 Verticals". From here you can select "all" or "none", or click shades individually, to select which shades you wish to adjust. "Retract" and "Extend" control the positioning of the shades.</p>
        <p>Note that the projectors use the central four pairs of shades.</p>
